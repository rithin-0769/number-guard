NumberGuard 🛡️
Secure your digital identity when changing phone numbers.

NumberGuard is a privacy-focused migration tool designed for the Indian digital ecosystem. It helps users track and manage accounts linked to their phone numbers (Banks, UPI, Government IDs, Social Media) before their old SIM card is recycled by telecom operators.

🇮🇳 The Problem
In India, telecom operators are permitted to recycle mobile numbers after 90 days of inactivity. If a user hasn't unlinked their Bank accounts, UPI IDs, or Aadhaar from that number, the new owner of the SIM could potentially gain access to their sensitive accounts.

✨ Core Features
🚀 Smart Scanner: Automatically identifies common high-risk services used in India (Aadhaar, SBI, IRCTC, Paytm, PhonePe, etc.).

⚠️ Recycle Risk Visualizer: Highlights "Critical" services and warns users about the 90-day recycling deadline.

🛑 UPI Safety Protocol: Interactive warnings for financial apps to ensure UPI IDs are deregistered before the number is abandoned.

📢 WhatsApp Broadcaster: Easily notify your entire contact list about your new number with a pre-formatted message.

💾 Local Vault: All your data is stored locally in your browser’s localStorage for maximum privacy.
